Matlab scripts to initialize and optimize gamma mixture models for incomplete data 
(left-truncated and right-censored) using the Nelder-Mead algorithm. 
We generated a series of exponential data, with different proportions
of fully-observed, left-truncated and right-sensored data.

Experimental results can be gained by running runNelderMead.m and will be saved in folder test1 and test2. 
Scripts started with "NM" is functions used during the Nelder-Mead algorithm, which are detailed in Algorithms 1 and 2.
